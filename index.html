        <p> Hey everybody! My name is Kyle Thomas, I grew up in Folsom, CA. I've spent most of my life heavily involved in sports and took a focus to basketball when I was 10. throughout high school i was ranked in the top 100 on rivals and played against many current NBA players. I had a rough time in college due to injuries, but I battled back to have a very solid collegiate career. I played 2 seasons professionally, 1 in Germany and 1 in the NBA d league. I hung up my sneakers after a series of injuries, but I loved my time as a pro basketball player.</p>

        <p>Since moving on from basketball I’ve developed my own business as a personal trainer where I train a variety of ages from normal everyday adults to kids prepping to potentially make the jump into collegiate sports. I’ve helped send over 20 high school athletes to college on full ride scholarships. In my free time I have taken a liking to web development and my main goal is to launch myself into a second career in this field as well as enhance my current fitness business with the use of technology.</p>
